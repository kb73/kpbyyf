###Reflections from podcast:

I really enjoyed the podcast. It put real people behind a lot of what we've just talked about in more general terms and gave a little bit of insight into who actually uses the metrics of CHAOSS and well as how it came to be from a need people had. I also like that it was somewhat relaxed and moreso just an open forum for discussion about the CHAOSS project rather that super nitty-gritty things.
