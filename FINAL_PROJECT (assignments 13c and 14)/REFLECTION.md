# Overview
The app I'm creating is actuall a plugin for an existing open source application called Bitbar (see README.md for download) which allows a user to add pretty much anything to their menu bar.

## 13c
For 13c I wrote the preliminary code and got some basic functionality down. I forgot to include what websites I used, but it was mostly just simple syntax things rather than workflow things. I wrote the code locally and then just copied it into Github.
The commit hash is: [ee4a787](https://github.com/kb73/kpbyyf/commit/ee4a7870f706107e064ba8647563fc81cc7e1a96)

## 14
My goal for the final version is to have SSO functionality added so that notes are persistent across multiple platforms, but I'm not entirely sure how that's going to work yet, since I have no idea how to connect Bash to SSO or a Backend, but I will do my best
