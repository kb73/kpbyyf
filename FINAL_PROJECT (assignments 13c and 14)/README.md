# Overview

Notes is a plugin for the application [Bitbar](https://getbitbar.com/) to keep track of a list of whatever you want.

## Use

- First make sure you have [Bitbar](https://getbitbar.com/) installed
- Download the `.sh` file from this repository and add it to your Bitbar plugins folder
- Refresh Bitbar and it will show up in the menu bar

## Additional Info

 - I am currently working on implementing SSO into the plugin to allow persistance of notes across multiple devices
