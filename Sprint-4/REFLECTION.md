Projects I looked at:
  - OAuth
  - OpenID Connect
  - Ory Hydra
  - Angular

One I chose: OpenID Connect (OIC)
  - I chose this one because there are a lot of resources on it and it is built on OAuth, which is very widely used and has a strong community. I chose OIC instead of OAuth because I leanred OAuth is for getting specific information and OIC is just for getting a user's basic information and validating who they are, which is all I wanted
  
 How far I got and obstacles
  - I got as far as learning the concepts behind OAuth and OIC, learning how to create an Angular app and a basic understanding of the app file tree (I've never used Angular nor done any legitimate web dev before), running nginx on ubuntu, and running a production version of an Angular website. I also did research into Angular Single Page Applications which authenticate a little differently with OIC (immediately gets token instead of code)
  - Obstacles encountered were many. I didn't know how to use Angular at all, so that was a big part of it. Also trying to find resources which worked with the latest versions of Angular, nginx, and node js proved difficult. I also had no idea how SSO logins worked on the backend, only from a users perspective. A lot of my time was consumed reading articles and do research to just get something off the ground
