I think I would choose the MIT License. It allows for use of the software in pretty much any case: for personal, public, and commercial. I cannot think of an instance where it couldn't be applied in anything I personally would be doing. Also, it provides no warranty, so I don't have to worry about buggy code, legally speaking, though I do strive for perfection in code that I write. I also don't have to worry about others using the code maliciously.
