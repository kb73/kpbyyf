The articles were very helpful at understanding the actual benefit to open source projects.
My previous perspective of open source projects were that they were just sort of things people did in their free time, which honestly kind of baffled me because they were so complex and I couldn't fathom having enough free time to work on side projects like that. But after learning how widely used they were in business, it made sense then that businesses would have a vested interest in mainting and updating the projects they use and thus pay employees to do as much.
Another thing that fascinated me was the culture behind open source. The fact that you have to build reputation and the longer and more frequently you work on a project gets you more respect within that community and also the social dynamic between businesses and open source was interesting and if a business did not interact well with any given community they could be shunned. All of these were things I had never even considered before and it almost makes it sound like a school playground where different people have different groups they hang out in and have influence over and if you mess with somebody you could get socially shunned from the group.
