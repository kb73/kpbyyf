As we go further in the semester, my goal is to be able to have users have a list of strings saved in a database and login with their google account. The login info will be do via SSO to verify the user and retrieve their information from the database.
- Audience: Anyone who needs to keep track of a list (assignments, groceries, contacts, etc.)
- Intention: Provide a clear and secure interface in which users can create, save, and update lists
