Things that worked:
- Most of the tutorial
- - Installing pipenv
- - Setting up virtual environments
- - Generating google credentials

Things that did not work:
- `python app.py` (had to use `python3 app.py`. Might be able to alias it in the future)

Visited Dex website to learn how to install
Visited flask website and flask-login to see if I needed to install it since the thing that didn't work above resulted in a ModuleNotFound error for the flask moudle

Goal for semester: I hope to, by the end of the semester have an app where users can save a list of strings to a backend which is verified by a google SSO. I'm not sure of the feasability since I am not intimately familiar with the technologies at play and how they may or may not interact.

One thing I'm discovering is just how many ways and services there are to use the same "ideology" of SSO. You can execute it on a myriad of platforms with a plethora of different languages and tools, the vast majority of which I have no idea how to use. I feel like a lot of college has bee explaining concepts and then executing them on a very classroom specific tool without teaching how to replicate a concept in different ways with different tools. I'm just wondering when the learning of those things will come in. Do I only learn specific tools after getting a job or am I expected to know how to use a variety of languages and tools prior to a career job?
