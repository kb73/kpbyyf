I though this video was very insightful. It was helpful to see what the process of collaborating on a change to an open source project looks like, as well as the quality control for what gets added. It did seem tedious at first, but as you guys went on to explain why some of the decisions were made and commented on things that needed to be changed to pull requests it became more clear as to why: in order to maintain consistency across the whole project.
